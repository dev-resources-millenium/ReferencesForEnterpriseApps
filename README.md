Before mentioning any references, want to discuss 2 important things -               
1) How to learn a new Technology?               
   Below steps can be helpful for the same(try to find the answers in the below order) -            
   a) What the Technology is all about? - Wiki, Blogs, Articles, Books etc can be helpful here.              
   b) When and Why to use it? - google for it and try to do in-depth research and find the rational behind why and when to use it.           
   c) When and Why NOT to use it? - In general, whenever some new language or some new technology lands up in the market we jump into 
      the conclusion that its the biggest thing ever and we should learn it because some XYZ comp is using it or its trendy in the
      market.Hold On!Nothing great than learning something new in general but also learn when and why not to use it and on those cases 
      dont go for using it.Never!Before applying any new technology\language analyse meticulously whether that language\technology is
      suitable for your requirements and the context of the project.And again google is there to help you.           
   d) How to use it? - Well, once again, google is there to help you.Get some simple, intermediate and then complex samples/examples/
      projects about the language/technology and understand them and then try to apply whatever you learned(from there) to your fun or 
      open source or company projects.             
2) How to learn any programming language?       
   Following steps as given below can be helpful -           
   a) Learn about the language from Wiki, Blogs, Articles, Books etc.               
   b) Programming Language Paradigms -           
      Some important paradigms to be understood which is supported by a typical language(whatever paradigm(s) are supported by the
      language, e.g. C# supports almost all the paradigms)-          
      i) Imperative Programming          
      ii) Object Oriented Programming         
      iii) Functional Programming        
      iv) Concurrent Programming(concurrency using thread, process, core & machine and should consider asynchronous programming as well)                
      v) Meta Programming(including Dynamic Programming)                  
      vi) Aspect Oriented Programming                
      vii) Reactive Programming(e.g. [Reactive Extensions](http://introtorx.com/) in C# & [Lightbend Reactive Architecture](https://www.lightbend.com/learn/lightbend-reactive-architecture) available via Java/Scala)                    
      viii) Declarative Programming(e.g. SQL is a declarative programming language)                 
   c) Get hold of some language editor or IDE.As per me, as of this writing [Visual Stduio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) seems to
      be the best editor for almost any language.Say you want to learn Python, download and install [Visual Stduio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and then go through [the basics of using VS Code with Python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) and then go through [advanced usage of Python with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).Hopefully after that, everything should be simple.          
   d) Understand the project folder structure.Real projects are structured to be modular, maintainable, extensible etc.All languages
      doesn't have the same folder structure.Understand the folder structure specific to the lanaguage e.g. [Java has a specific Directory structure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html).                   
   e) Understand how to run and debug some language based project using your favourite editor/IDE(as mentioned earlier, mine is [Visual Stduio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).First find the entry point of the application/project and then understand the code flow by debugging the code.      
   f) Build your own fun or open source or company based project in that language.  
   g) Also important is to understand the build system specific to the language e.g in .NET world MSBuild is the main tool for building a .NET project while for Java there are options like ANT, Maven and Gradle.             
   N.B. - If you are already proficient in some language , one way to work on projects in other languages is to first thinking of the design and implementaion in the proficient language and then finding the corresponding code constructs in the other language and using them accordingly.And you know what, this approach has a term called [T-Shaped Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills).                          
                
Now lets turn our attention to our main topic of References.         
            
Lets start with some important resources for cracking language agnostic(& open ended) interviews -           
   a) [Data Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) and [Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) - Some really good texts to refer are [Narasimha Karumanchi's Books](http://www.careermonk.com/)(mainly "Data Structures and Algorithms made Easy in Java" and "Algorithm Design Techniques"), [Essential Algorithms](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Essential+Algorithms%3A+A+Practical+Approach+to+Computer+Algorithms+Using+Python+and+C%23%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119575993#content-section), [Six Small Algorithm Projects with Python](https://www.manning.com/liveprojectseries/algorithm-projects-python-ser), [Design and analysis of Algorithms,2/e](https://www.amazon.in/Design-analysis-Algorithms-Himanshu-Dave-ebook/dp/B00LOBJZ8C), [Published Books By Anany Levitin](http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~levitin/), [Udi Manber's Introduction to Algorithms](http://manber.com/)([Udi Manber's Seminal paper on Using Mathematical Induction to Design Algorithms](http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/teaching/CSS_e10/Manber88.pdf)), [Aditya Chatterjee's Books](https://www.amazon.in/Aditya-Chatterjee/e/B083768JQQ/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1), [LeetCode Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/), [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)(mainly go through "Data Structures" and "Algorithms" within Tutorials), [Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.manning.com/books/advanced-algorithms-and-data-structures) and [Awesome Algorithms](https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms).          
   For Divide and Conquer and Dynamic Programming problems, the toughest job seems to be finding the recurrence relation(based on equalities and non-equalities concepts).Also, a majority of the Dynamic Programming problems can be categorized into Optimization problems(a problem of finding the best[min/max] solution from all feasible solutions) and combinatorial problems(expects to figure out the number of ways to do something or the probablity of some event happening).Some other complex algorithmic problems are Graph Theory based problems. Some resources in these respects are [Recurrence Relations](http://people.reed.edu/~ormsbyk/113Fall2017/recurrence.pdf), Dynamic Programming Patterns ([I](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/dynamic-programming-patterns) and [II](https://algo.monster/problems/dynamic_programming_intro)), [Top 50 Dynamic Programming Practice Problems](https://medium.com/techie-delight/top-50-dynamic-programming-practice-problems-4208fed71aa3), [100+ Dynamic Programming Problems](https://iq.opengenus.org/list-of-dynamic-programming-problems/), [Dynamic Programming Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), [LeetCode Graph Patterns](https://medium.com/@timpark0807/leetcode-is-easy-graph-patterns-5fdfc8752774), [Design Patterns for the Implementation of Graph Algorithms](http://www.dietmar-kuehl.de/generic-graph-algorithms.pdf), [How To Think In Graphs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/i-dont-understand-graph-theory-1c96572a1401/)([Top Graph Theory Resources](https://neo4j.com/blog/top-13-resources-graph-theory-algorithms/)), [Graph data structure cheat sheet for coding interviews](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-data-structure-cheat-sheet-for-coding-interviews-a38aadf8aa87), [CSES Problems Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/)     
   For P, NP, NP-Complete and NP-Hard Complexity Classes refer [P, NP, NP-Complete and NP-Hard Problems in Computer Science](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/p-np-np-complete-np-hard), [NP Completeness Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness), [NP Problems List](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-list-of-NP-problems), [Theoretical Computer Science Resources](https://www.quora.com/What-are-must-read-books-on-theoretical-computer-science)            
   Using the above Data Structures and Algorithms resources, everythging works fine as long as you are working at in-memory level.But what if the data set is so massive that you cant store in-memory and need to store it in some hardisk(or may be hard disks of multiple machines).Well then, for such scenarios its important to have knowledge of External Memory Algorithms and I/O Efficient Data Structures & Algorithms and for the aforementioned topics, one can refer [Algorithms and Data Structures for Massive Datasets](https://www.manning.com/books/algorithms-and-data-structures-for-massive-datasets), [External Memory Algorithms Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_memory_algorithm), Resources by Jeffrey Scott Vitter([I](https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall05/cps130/lectures/vitter.papers/Vit.IO_survey.pdf), [II](https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ws10/models_of_computation/ExternalMemorySurveyVitter.pdf) and [III](https://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jsv/Papers/Vit.IO_book.pdf)), [Handbook of Massive Datasets](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4615-0005-6), [When RAM is Not Enough: Computing with Massive Data Sets](http://www.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs345/spring11/) and [I/O-Efficient Algorithms and Data Structures](https://imada.sdu.dk/~rolf/Edu/DM207/E11/)                         
   While working on real world projects, it might seem that Data Structures and Algorithms are not that much needed but the truth is that there are many fields of Computer Science where these are must and some of these fields are like High Performance Scientific and Engineering Computational Applications, building AI/ML/BigData Frameworks, projects related to [IEOR Courses @ IIT Bombay](https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/acad/courses) etc.    
   *Parallel & High Performance Computing - For Parallel & High Performance Computing, one can refer [Shared Memory Vs Distributed Memory](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/26681/a-good-simple-book-resource-on-parallel-programming-in-c-for-scientific-compu), [Introduction to Parallel Computing](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-parallel/0201648652/), [Parallel Computation Patterns](https://patterns.eecs.berkeley.edu/?page_id=21), [Selim Akl's Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selim_Akl#Publications), [Parallel and Distributed Computation: Numerical Methods](http://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/pdc.html), [Parallel and High Performance Computing](https://www.manning.com/books/parallel-and-high-performance-computing), [OpenMP Fundamentals](http://faculty.juniata.edu/rhodes/smui/openmp.html), [Some Good Resources for OpenMP and MPI](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5096768/books-on-parallel-programming-in-openmp-and-mpi/5115411), OpenCL vs CUDA([I](https://create.pro/opencl-vs-cuda/#:~:text=As%20we%20have%20already%20stated,and%20OpenCL%20is%20open%20source.&text=If%20you%20enable%20OpenCL%2C%20only,can%20be%20used%20for%20GPGPU.) & [II](https://www.videomaker.com/article/c15/19313-cuda-vs-opencl-vs-opengl)) and [Some good CUDA resources](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-books-archive).Although SOAP based services and Restful services(in .NET or Java or some other language) can be used for Distributed Memory based systems but when you ask for performance nothing is near to MPI(in C/C++). Also .NET's Task Parallel Library or some Java Parallel Programming constructs may seem similar to OpenMP but again in terms of performance, say for processing a machine with 1000 cores, OpenMP shines like anything.For Fortran, it seems the best option is to use the language in-built parallel/distributed structure named co-arrays.                              
    *Competitive Programming - For Competitive Prgramming, one can refer [IOI Recommended Reading](https://ioinformatics.org/page/recommended-reading/11), [Awesome Competitive Programming](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming), [Indian Computing Olympiad Past Problems](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/archives.php), [Looking For a Challenge?](http://www.lookingforachallengethebook.com/) and [IOI Past Problems](https://ioinformatics.org/page/contests/10).

   b) [OOPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [Software Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) and [System Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design#:~:text=Systems%20design%20is%20the%20process,systems%20theory%20to%20product%20development.) -  For Design Patterns, one can refer [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do), [Elemental Design Patterns](https://www.infoq.com/articles/elemental_design_patterns/) and [Refactoring to Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321213351?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321213351). For an extensive list of resourses on OOPs and Patterns, refer [Patterns Literature](https://insightsdelight.wordpress.com/tag/application-architecture-patterns/).           
   Again from the Systems Design perspective, some good resources are like [Udemy's Software Architecture and Technology of Large-Scale Systems Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/developer-to-architect/), [Awesome System Design](https://github.com/madd86/awesome-system-design), [System Design Resources](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-prepare-to-answer-design-questions-in-a-technical-interview?redirected_qid=1500023), [Gainlo's System Design Interview Questions](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/category/system-design-interview-questions/), [Object Oriented Design Questions](https://www.careercup.com/page?pid=object-oriented-design-interview-questions),[Design Questions](https://www.careercup.com/page?pid=design-interview-questions),[Software Design Questions](https://www.careercup.com/page?pid=software-design-interview-questions), [System Design Interview Questions](https://www.careercup.com/page?pid=system-design-interview-questions), [Large Scale Computing Questions](https://www.careercup.com/page?pid=large-scale-computing-interview-questions), [Trading System Design](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/trading-system-design-books-suggestion.251314/), [System Design Cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/banunatina/3959f128a8c7d20f79807fbccdf2e8bc), [CPU Cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache), [Mechanical Sympathy](https://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.in/), [Operating System Support for Warehouse Scale Computing]( https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ms705/pub/thesis-submitted.pdf).Some related youtube videos are [Narendra L's playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn1XnDWhsLS5URXTi5wtFTA/playlists) and [Tushar Roy's playlists](https://www.youtube.com/user/tusharroy2525/playlists).        
                            
Now for the [DDD Project](https://github.com/sandipray63in/DDD-Based-Enterprise-Application-Framework), the references used or were supposed to be used are as follows(not that everything mentioned below is referred to build [the DDD framework](https://github.com/sandipray63in/DDD-Based-Enterprise-Application-Framework), but atleast some bits of each of these awesome resources mentioned below have been referred or was supposed to be referred) - 
1) [Patterns, Principles and Practices of Domain Driven Design](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Patterns-Principles-and-Practices-of-Domain-Driven-Design.productCd-1118714709.html).               
2) [JavaScript Domain Driven Design](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/javascript-domain-driven-design).        
3) [Practical Domain-Driven Design in Enterprise Java](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484245422).        
4) [Coding for Domain Driven Design](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn342868.aspx).              
5) [Domain Driven Design Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).             
6) Some very good samples to look out for DDD are [Domain-Driven Design Using a Trading Application Example](https://archfirst.org/bullsfirst/), [DDD E-Commerce Sample](https://github.com/zkavtaskin/Domain-Driven-Design-Example), [Domain Driven Design Using SpringTrader](https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/products/springone-video-domain-driven-design-using-springtrader), [Click's Hexagonal Domain Driven Architecture](https://github.com/ClickTravel/Cheddar) and [Reactive DDD/CQRS using Akka](https://www.infoq.com/news/2014/06/ddd-cqrs-akka-application). Some other good open source DDD apps are like- [I](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152120/are-there-any-open-source-projects-using-ddd-domain-driven-design) and [II](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/540130/good-domain-driven-design-samples).             
7) [CQRS Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation#Command_Query_Responsibility_Segregation), [How Eventuate Works](http://eventuate.io/howeventuateworks.html), [Rinat Abdullin On CQRS](https://abdullin.com/tags/cqrs/), [CQRS Myths](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/08/22/busting-some-cqrs-myths/), [When To Avoid CQRS](http://udidahan.com/2011/04/22/when-to-avoid-cqrs/) and [CQRS Examples](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5043513/cqrs-examples-and-screencasts).
8) If one wants to think of any imaginable data source as Repository then at least for the query side it's better to have a IQueryable provider for the same (at least to use [this framework](https://github.com/sandipray63in/DDD-Based-Enterprise-Application-Framework) seamlessly). For an exhaustive list of open source IQueryable providers, one can visit [Linq to Everything](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/charlie/2008/02/28/link-to-everything-a-list-of-linq-providers/) (well, it's almost EVERYTHING).If some imaginable data source is not mentioned in the afore-mentioned list then one can build his/her own IQueryable provider and hopefully the articles viz. [LINQ: Building an IQueryable provider series](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mattwar/2008/11/18/linq-building-an-iqueryable-provider-series/), [Building Custom LINQ Enabled Data Providers](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/tommer/2007/04/20/building-custom-linq-enabled-data-providers-using-iqueryablet/), [Creating LINQToTwitter library using LinqExtender](http://weblogs.asp.net/mehfuzh/creating-linqtotwitter-library-using-linqextender) and [Writing A Custom LINQ Provider With Re-linq](https://blog.fairwaytech.com/2013/03/writing-a-custom-linq-provider-with-re-linq) can be helpful in doing the same. And if anyone builds any LINQ to Something (or "Anything") provider, then please don't forget to share it with the world. Some other intriguing reads on LINQ are [Analytic Functions using LINQ](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/wiki/Window-Functions-(Analytic-Functions)), [SqlDependency Based Caching of LINQ Queries](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/141589/SqlDependency-based-caching-of-LINQ-Queries), [Dynamically evaluated SQL LINQ queries](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/43678/Dynamically-evaluated-SQL-LINQ-queries), [Building LINQ Queries at Runtime in C#](http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx/) and [Specification Design Pattern](https://codingsight.com/specification-design-pattern-in-c/).
9) Again for Unity based DI/IoC container, one can refer [Dependency Injection with Unity](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=39944) and [Microsoft Unity Succintly](https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/microsoftunity).        
10) [Almost Anything and Everything about ASP.NET Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/
)(including [ASP.NET WEB API 2: HTTP MESSAGE LIFECYLE](http://www.asp.net/media/4071077/aspnet-web-api-poster.pdf)), [Web API Versioning](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETCoreRESTfulWebAPIVersioningMadeEasy.aspx) and [Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026617.do)([source code](https://github.com/webapibook/issuetracker)). To learn the basics of ASP.NET MVC one can go through [ASP.NET MVC Interview Questions](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/556995/ASP-NET-MVC-interview-questions-with-answers).Also one can go through [ASP.NET MVC Page Life Cycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/lifecycle-of-an-aspnet-mvc-5-application) and [ASP.NET MVC Pipeline And Extensibility](https://www.infoq.com/news/2011/09/aspnet-extensibility) as well to understand the ASP.NET Page Lifecycle and ASP.NET MVC Extensibility. Also do have a look on [Building Custom Owin Middlewares](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26214113/how-can-i-safely-intercept-the-response-stream-in-a-custom-owin-middleware) and [Building OAuth2.0 using Owin series](http://bitoftech.net/2015/02/16/implement-oauth-json-web-tokens-authentication-in-asp-net-web-api-and-identity-2/)(to get insights into SSO using JWT for cross domain one can refer [this SO article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33723033/single-sign-on-flow-using-jwt-for-cross-domain-authentication)).For API documentation one should use [Swagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swagger_(software)) and a good resource w.r.t ASP.NET Web API is [Swagger and ASP.NET Web API](http://wmpratt.com/swagger-and-asp-net-web-api-part-1/).                          
11) [WCF Basics](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/759331/Interview-Questions-Answers-Windows-Communication), [Programming WCF Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/programming-wcf-security), WCF Versioning([Data Versioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/best-practices-data-contract-versioning) & [Service Versioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/service-versioning)) and [SOA Apps Using WCF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/). Also, to build BPM solutions using Windows Workflow Foundation, one can refer [WWF docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/). Also have a look on one of the most important topic within WCF(which most of us neglect), which is [WCF Extensibility(series)](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/carlosfigueira/2011/03/14/wcf-extensibility/). Some other important things to seek are [WCF with SSL](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/wcf-application-implementing-the-anonymous-client-over-certi/), [Configure a Port with an SSL Certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-a-port-with-an-ssl-certificate), [IIS Apppool Identity access to certs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2609859/how-to-give-asp-net-access-to-a-private-key-in-a-certificate-in-the-certificate), [WCF Scalability](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43823/how-well-will-wcf-scale-to-a-large-number-of-client-users), [WCF Dynamic Proxy](http://dotnetmentors.com/wcf/creating-dynamic-proxy-using-wcf-channelfactory.aspx), [Creating WCF ChannelFactory<T>](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3200197/creating-wcf-channelfactoryt), [Unity.WCF](https://www.devtrends.co.uk/blog/introducing-unity.wcf-providing-easy-ioc-integration-for-your-wcf-services), [WCF Proxy and IoC](https://therealmofcode.com/posts/2015/05/wcf-proxy-and-inversion-of-control.html), [WCF Service Resolution Container Extension](http://www.primordialcode.com/blog/post/unity-wcf-service-resolution-container-extension) and [WCF Tracing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/configuring-tracing).

**If at all [the DDD codebase](https://github.com/sandipray63in/DDD-Based-Enterprise-Application-Framework) is migrated to .NET Core then hopefully [ASP.NET Core Documentation](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/) and [Porting to .NET Core](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/02/10/porting-to-net-core/) will be pretty much helpfull.But currently lots of .NET Framework stuffs are not supported by the current .NET Core version as verified by [.NET Portability Analyzer Tool](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1177943e-cfb7-4822-a8a6-e56c7905292b).Also don't have any plans to have a mix and match of .NET Framework and .NET Core environment working together since that would have its own challenges(didn't do any thorough analysis though) and the whole point of using .NET(wholly) for LINUX/MAC is missing in such an approach(although one might suggest to deploy .NET Framework code as a Web Service deployed in a Windows machine while the .NET Core code deployed in some LINUX/MAC machine consuming the Web Service but for sure, that would have its own challenges).Anyways, that's secondary and so MIGHT be taken care at some later point of time.Some other helpful links w.r.t .NET Core are [Awesome .NET Core](https://github.com/thangchung/awesome-dotnet-core) and [Asp Net Core Open Source Projects](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/asp-net-core).                      

*** One of the best way to learn SPA, REST/MicroServices and DDD (including CQRS and Event Sourcing) is to grab some existing good open source projects and then gather the requirements (from the source code), analyze the requirements, architect/design/implement the requirements (along with unit/integration/acceptance testing) using principles of SPA, REST/MicroServices and DDD (may be if needed, can apply parts/whole of [the DDD Framework](https://github.com/sandipray63in/DDD-Based-Enterprise-Application-Framework) for the same). Some intriguing open source projects in this regard are -        
a) ASP.NET - [ASP.NET Samples](https://github.com/aspnet/samples).A good article with regards to comparison of various ASP.NET Technologies is [WEB FORMS, MVC, SINGLE PAGE APP, WEB PAGES COMPARISON](https://venute.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/web-forms-mvc-single-page-app-web-pages-comparison-prasad-honrao/).Also its very important to understand Server Side Rendering and Client Side Rendering to understand the differences between approaches of ASP.NET MVC and WebForms w.r.t that of Web API alongwith some JS Framework and for that one can refer [Rendering On the Web](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web) and [JavaScript SEO: Server Side Rendering vs. Client Side Rendering](https://medium.com/@benjburkholder/javascript-seo-server-side-rendering-vs-client-side-rendering-bc06b8ca2383).My thumb rule is to use ASP.NET WebForms(if its a brownfield app) or ASP.NET MVC(if its a greenfield app), if server side rendering is required(may be because of complex UI rendering logic or some usage of server controls tightly binded to DB) while if Client Side Rendering is required then to opt for ASP.NET WEb API alongwith some recent JS Framework like React or Angular or Vue or normal JS(alongwith JQuery).                   
b) E-Commerce - [NopCommerce](https://www.nopcommerce.com/), [SmartStore.NET](https://www.smartstore.com/en/net/) and [Virto Commerce](https://virtocommerce.com/).          
c) Trading - [StockSharp](https://stocksharp.com/), [QuantConnect's Lean](https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/), [Marketcetera](https://marketcetera.com/) and [Modulus](https://modulus.io/).              
d) Telecom Billing - [jBilling](http://www.jbilling.com/)(the Cloud Computing billing model works somewhat in similar lines).[Managing Recurring Events In a Data Model](https://www.vertabelo.com/blog/technical-articles/again-and-again-managing-recurring-events-in-a-data-model) is a good read on a DB design approach for handling recurring events(any Billing system has some portions of it which can be visualized as recurring events).Also have a look into the related topics of [Dynamic Pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pricing), [Pricing Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing_strategies) and [Price Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_optimization)(if possible, may be build some open source Pricing Framework).          
e) CMS - [DotNetNuke](https://www.dnnsoftware.com/), [Orchard](https://orchardproject.net/) and [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/).       
f) CRM - [SplendidCRM](http://www.splendidcrm.com/), [ASP.NET CRM](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=crm) and [Coevery](https://github.com/Coevery/Coevery).        
g) Personalization - [My Web Pages Starter Kit](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=mywebpagesstarterkit).             
h) Web Portal - [DropThings](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/35193/web-2-0-ajax-portal-using-jquery-asp-net-3-5-silve) and [ASP.NET Portal Starter Kit](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=aspnetportal).         
i) Social News - [Kigg](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=aspnetportal).       
j) Blog - [BlogEngine.NET](https://github.com/rxtur/BlogEngine.NET).          
k) ECM(Enterprise Content anagement) - [SenseNet](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet).            
l) SOA - [.NET Stock Trader](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb499684.aspx).            
m) Workflows(along-with some Utilities) - [NeoVolve.Toolkit](https://github.com/roryprimrose/Neovolve.Toolkit).This project is more of a toolkit, the utilities and concepts of which can be used to build REST/DDD based Workflow projects.Also watch out for WWF based PageFlow samples like [Rule Driven Pageflow / Workflow](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Rule-Driven-Pageflow-fc765617), [ASP.Net Page Navigation using Workflow 4.0](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/sridhar_subra/Asp-Net-page-navigation-using-workflow-4-0/) and the WWF based Rehosting project viz. - [Rehosted Workflow Designer](https://github.com/orosandrei/Rehosted-Workflow-Designer).            
n) ERP - [WebVella](https://github.com/WebVella/WebVella-ERP), [MixERP](https://github.com/mixerp/mixerp), [MERP](https://github.com/mastreeno/Merp) and [Frappe](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext
).         
o) Concurrency - [Parallel Programming Samples](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ParExtSamples) and [Parallel Programming Extras](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/a-tour-of-parallelextensionsextras/). Again, please note that these projects are not mentioned for learning SPA or REST or DDD principles directly but the underlying principles can be used for some REST/DDD based projects at the server side.          
p) Monitoring - [Wolfpack Distributed System Monitoring](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=wolfpack).Again, this is not mentioned so that this monitoring project can be transformed into a project following all DDD principles but just mentioned so that people(who are not aware of this tool yet) can be aware of this awesome open source distributed system monitoring tool.         
q) Some other stuffs(which might be useful) - Some other good code galleries(or projects) to watch out for are [ASP.NET Core Samples](https://github.com/aspnet/samples), [.NET Core Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/core/tree/master/samples), [.NET Framework Technologies Samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-3.5/bb400848(v=vs.90)), [MicroDot(Samples)](https://github.com/gigya/microdot), [Hibernating Rhinos Git Repositories](https://github.com/hibernating-rhinos), [iDesign's Downloadables](http://www.idesign.net/Downloads), [Particular Software's Git Repositories](https://github.com/Particular), [Wintellect's Git Repositories](https://github.com/Wintellect), [HDInsight Git Repository](https://github.com/hdinsight), [Microsoft Mobius](https://github.com/Microsoft/Mobius)(somewhat like a .NET port of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)) etc.      

Other Good Resources – Most of the references mentioned above are really good(especially for developing [the DDD Application Framework](https://github.com/sandipray63in/DDD-Based-Enterprise-Application-Framework)) but the resources mentioned below can hopefully make one a better Coder/Designer/Architect/Systems Programmer –>

 • One very important programming language paradigm is Functional Programming and although inherently functional languages like  JavaScript has been moving towards Object Orientation(ES6 and ES7) but the irony is that the traditional Object Oriented languages like Java, C# have been moving more towards the functional side and for functional approaches, one can refer(mainly JS and .NET based language resources) - [Grokking Simplicity](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-simplicity?query=grokking), [Grokking Functional Programming](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-functional-programming?query=grokking), [So you want to be a Functional Programmer](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-6-db502830403#.5noh8ieb8), [Functional Programming in C#](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Functional-Programming-in-C-Classic-Programming-Techniques-for-Modern-Projects.productCd-0470744588.html), [LINQ and Functional Programming via C#](http://weblogs.asp.net/dixin/linq-via-csharp), [Learning F#](http://fsharp.org/learn.html), [Functional JavaScript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do), [Functional Programming in Javascript](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/functional-programming-javascript) and [Persistent DataStructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure).For Patterns on Functional Programming, refer [FP Design Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8I19uA-wGY), [Where are all the Functional Programming Design Patterns](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/89273/where-are-all-the-functional-programming-design-patterns)(Check for the answer by Corbin March) and [Does Functional Programming Replace GoF Design Patterns](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327955/does-functional-programming-replace-gof-design-patterns).           
                   
• Also do refer [The Best Programming Languages for Each Situation](https://tomassetti.me/best-programming-languages/) to get a gist of the right language to be used for the job. Some best of the best resources, to learn different language intricacies, can be found at [Mark Summerfield's Recommended Books](http://www.qtrac.eu/biblio.html) and [Notes for Professionals Books](https://books.goalkicker.com/). One of the best methods to understand and learn a programming language is [Project Based Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning) and to do that, some good resources are [Mega Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects), [Learn Programming Project-Based: Build-Your-Own-X](https://paulvanderlaken.com/2019/09/14/learn-programming-project-based-build-your-own-x/), [Open Source Project Ideas](https://github.com/open-source-ideas/open-source-ideas/blob/master/README.md) and [App Ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas).          
  Some Language Specific Resources are as follows -        
                  
  i) Javascript and Node JS(& other JS Frameworks) - For JS, the best resource is [You dont know JS series]( https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS). Other
     good resources are [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/),[Node.js Design Patterns](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/), [Node.js Architecture slides from Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?searchfrom=header&q=node.js+architect), Awesome JS([I](https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript) and [II](https://github.com/micromata/awesome-javascript-learning)), Awesome Node JS([I](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs) and [II](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-awesome-nodejs)), [Good Open Source Node JS Projects](https://github.com/sqreen/awesome-nodejs-projects) and [A beginner’s guide to making Progressive Web Apps](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/a-beginners-guide-to-making-progressive-web-apps-beb56224948e).           
     Some helpful links w.r.t Angular, React and Vue can be [Choosing the “Right” JavaScript Library/Framework for Your Application](https://blog.codewithdan.com/choosing-the-right-javascript-library-framework-for-your-application/#tc-comment-title), [Angular vs ReactJS vs Vue.js with Examples and Demos](https://www.dotnetcurry.com/vuejs/1372/vuejs-vs-angular-reactjs-compare), [Udemy's React JS, Angular & Vue JS - Quickstart & Comparison Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-reactjs-vuejs-quickstart-comparison/), [Udemy's Angular Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/), [Udemy's React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/), [10 Angular and TypeScript Projects to Take You From Zero to Hero](https://blog.codewithdan.com/10-angular-and-typescript-projects-to-take-you-from-zero-to-hero/), [Github Realworld Projects](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld), [Angular Docs](https://angular.io/docs), [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), [Angular Open Source Projects](https://medium.com/flatlogic/top-angular-open-source-projects-6e9b91a455c0), [Awesome Typescript Projects](https://github.com/brookshi/awesome-typescript-projects) and [React Open Source Projects](https://flatlogic.com/blog/best-react-open-source-projects/).For testing Angular and React projetcs, one can use [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/#/) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) respectively.                    
                  
  ii) Java -   Specifically for Java, one can refer [Learn Core Java](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/07/top-9-java-programming-books-best-must-read.html), [Learn Java 8 and Functional Programming](https://www.java67.com/2015/07/5-books-learn-java-8-functional-programming.html), [Learn Java Virtual Machine, Garbage Collection, and Performance](https://www.java67.com/2019/08/best-books-to-learn-java-virtual-machine-in-depth.html), [Core J2EE Patterns](https://github.com/RameshMF/j2ee-design-patterns), [Spring Framework Resources for Experienced Developers](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/04/5-spring-framework-books-experienced-Java-developers-2018.html)(including [Spring Tutorial](https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/spring-a-head-start-introduction-part-1-130aa1b41e47) & [Spring Docs](https://spring.io/docs)), [Hibernate Resources for Java Developers](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/08/top-5-hibernate-books-for-java.html), [Integrating Java With C++](https://www.javaworld.com/article/2077513/java-tip-17--integrating-java-with-c--.html), [Java InterOp Mini Series](https://z0ltan.wordpress.com/2016/10/07/interop-mini-series-calling-c-and-c-callbacks-from-java-part-4/),  [Java Interview Questions](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/10/133-java-interview-questions-answers-from-last-5-years.html), [Java Puzzlers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javatm-puzzlers-traps/032133678X/) and [Awesome Java](https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java).       
               
  iii) Assembly/C/C++/Fortran - These languages are the best from System Level performance perspective.Assembly/C/C++ are still used in
     most Systems Programming environments(including Embedded Systems).For Assembly one can refer  [Assembly Language Succintly](https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/assemblylanguage) and [Awesome-ASM](https://github.com/lurumdare/awesome-asm).For some good C resources, refer [Project Based tutorials in C](https://github.com/rby90/Project-Based-Tutorials-in-C), Awesome C([I](https://github.com/kozross/awesome-c),[II](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-c),[III](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-c)) and [Domain Driven Design in C](https://brainbaking.com/post/domain-driven-design-in-c/).For some good C++ resources, refer [Good Open Source C++](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4324169/good-open-source-code-for-c), Awesome C++([I](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp), [II](https://github.com/rigtorp/awesome-modern-cpp) and [III](https://github.com/fenbf/AwesomePerfCpp)) and [DDD in C++](https://cppdepend.com/blog/?p=672).              
     Fortran might seem to be an obsolete language but its actually still being used for scientific and engineering numerical
     applications(especially for distributed numerical computation based apps, infact some financial institutions use it for their trading apps as well) and for Fortran, some good resources are [Modern Fortran](https://www.manning.com/books/modern-fortran), [Modern Fortran Explained](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198811896/fortran-wiki-20) and [Awesome Fortran](https://github.com/rabbiabram/awesome-fortran).          
                
  iv) Python - [Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python), [Awesome Python Applications](https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications) and [Dynamic DDD](https://github.com/valignatev/ddd-dynamic) seems to be some really good resources for Python.           
            
  v) Erlang/Elixir - Most of the languages work well from Concurrency and Availability perspective but what if you want around [5 9s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#%22Nines%22) of Availability(like some Telecom projects).Say hello to the [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language))/[OTP](https://github.com/erlang/otp) based language viz.[Elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)).For [Elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)) one can refer [Elixir Succintly](https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/elixir-succinctly), [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition), [The Little Elixir and OTP Guidebook](https://www.manning.com/books/the-little-elixir-and-otp-guidebook) and [Phoenix in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/phoenix-in-action)([Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(web_framework)) is an [Elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)) based Web Framework).

  A concerning area related to performance is High CPU Usage.High CPU Usage may happen because of various reasons like a program gets stuck in an infinite loop or encounters an unexpected error or some virus or adware infection has occurred, which should be addressed immediately.Some pointers in this respect(not exhaustive) w.r.t .NET code are [How to Troubleshoot IIS Worker Process (w3wp) High CPU Usage](https://stackify.com/w3wp-high-cpu-usage/), [How to handle and avoid high CPU](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/2016-01-25-identify-and-protect-against-high-cpu-and-memory-usage.html), [Tight Loop Issue and Resolution](https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/175229/Threading-and-CPU-usage-100), [High CPU usage in C# multi-threaded code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33655152/high-cpu-usage-in-c-sharp-multi-threaded-code), [Multi-threaded C# Application hitting High CPU Usage](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26643737/multi-thread-c-sharp-application-hitting-high-cpu-usage), [C# Moving panel with mouse causes high CPU usage](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/677f86d7-a575-4980-b876-6783cfe3d819/c-moving-panel-with-mouse-causes-high-cpu-usage), [Named pipes in service causes high CPU usage](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17193573/named-pipes-in-service-causes-high-cpu-usage) etc.       
              
  Memory Leaks in code can be another big issue.Some pointers in this respect w.r.t .NET code are [Find, Fix, and Avoid Memory Leaks in C# .NET: 8 Best Practices](https://michaelscodingspot.com/find-fix-and-avoid-memory-leaks-in-c-net-8-best-practices/), [Detecting .NET applicarion memory leaks](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/shivprasadk/best-practices-no-5-detecting-net-application-memory-leaks/), [Memory leaks in .Net applications.

 N.B. - In an Enterprise, Jenkins or Ansible or Chef might be already setup via master slave architecture for different environments viz. Dev, SIT, UAT, Pre-Prod, Prod etc and one might just need to setup scripts for communication between master and slave and setup the client nodes.Check the onboarding documents(if available) for the same.

   One more topic related to IoT is [Wireless Sensor Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_sensor_network) and for that one can refer [Best WSN Texts](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Can_anyone_tell_me_the_best_books_related_to_Wireless_Sensor_Networks), [Building Wireless Sensor Networks Using Arduino](https://www.packtpub.com/in/hardware-and-creative/building-wireless-sensor-networks-using-arduino) and [Hands-On Wireless Sensor Networks with ESP32](https://www.packtpub.com/in/networking-and-servers/hands-wireless-sensor-networks-esp32-video).      
    Antother topic of interest in IoT field is Audio and Video Processing and Communication and for that one can refer [RTP in C#](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4767491/streaming-avi-files-from-c-sharp-using-rtp).        
   And the last(but by no means the least) important topic w.r.t IoT is Pervasive(Ubiquitious) Computing and for that one can refer [Pervasive Computing: Technology and Architecture of Mobile Internet Applications](https://www.informit.com/store/pervasive-computing-technology-and-architecture-of-9780201722154) and [Pervasive Computing : The Mobile World](https://link.springer.com/book/9783540002185)
